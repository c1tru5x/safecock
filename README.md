A CS2 READONLY Hack in Python

Functions so far implemented:

healthCheck(): return health of the enemies in the console for each player alive
checkDefuse(): if enemyTeam is defusing (and has a Defuser or not)
trigger(): uses mouseclick emulations instead of writing to the game memory

Hack may need to be reloaded after warmup or if the team has changed
